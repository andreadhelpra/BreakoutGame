USAGE: Once the users run the program, they are redirected to a main menu homepage (Demo Source and Support, n.d.). Here a message is displayed inviting the user to choose a username.
When the start button is clicked, the first level starts. Two sets of bricks of different colours are shown on the screen. The blue ones will destroy at the first touch from the ball, the red ones need two hits to be destroyed. There is also an extra orange brick for each level. This one does not need to get destroyed to pass the level, but if hit it will give a bonus life. 
The score is shown at the top and this is added every time a brick is destroyed. The users have 3 lives and each time the ball touches the bottom edge of the screen, they lose one of them, as well as losing score. The bat is used to avoid the ball to fall and to redirect to destroy the bricks.
If all bricks are destroyed the gamer will be able to play the second and last level of the game, which is harder. After the completion of the second level, the gamer can choose to be redirected to the first level.
